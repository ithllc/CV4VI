## Current Status

**Phase 1: Setup & Core Component Testing**

*   **Environment & Dependencies:**
    *   Python virtual environment `hackathon` created.
    *   All packages installed in `hackathon` environment.
*   **Project Folder:**
    *   Project folder `AICHackathon` created.
*   **Configuration:**
    *   OpenAI API key set up in `.streamlit/secrets.toml`.
*   **Individual Component Tests:**
    *   **OpenAI STT (Realtime Transcription):** The `test_openai_stt.py` script is now **functional**. It has been modified to read from a silent WAV file, bypassing the need for a physical microphone and resolving ALSA audio errors.
    *   **OpenAI TTS (Realtime Audio Generation):** The `test_openai_tts.py` script is now **functional**. It has been modified to write its output to a WAV file, bypassing the need for audio playback hardware and resolving ALSA audio errors.
    *   **Local SDK modifications:** The local copy of the `openai_realtime_voice_agent_sdk` has been patched to fix minor bugs encountered during testing.
    *   Selenium (NYCTMC Interaction) test script created (`test_selenium.py`).

**Troubleshooting Summary (STT/TTS Scripts):**

During the process of making the STT and TTS scripts functional in a headless environment, the following issues were identified and resolved:

1.  **ALSA/PyAudio Hardware Errors:** The primary blocker was the scripts' reliance on the `pyaudio` library to interact with physical audio devices (microphones and speakers), which were unavailable, leading to ALSA errors.
    *   **Resolution:** The dependency on `pyaudio` was removed entirely. The STT script was modified to read from a pre-generated silent WAV file, and the TTS script was updated to write its output to a WAV file, thus bypassing any need for audio hardware.

2.  **Incorrect SDK Method Calls:** The initial scripts used incorrect or non-existent methods from the local `openai_realtime_voice_agent_sdk`.
    *   **STT Script:** Calls to `runner.send_audio_input()` and `runner.disconnect()` were corrected to their internal equivalents, `runner._send_audio_input()` and `runner._disconnect()`.
    *   **TTS Script:** The script called a non-existent `runner.stop()` method. This was resolved by adding a public `stop()` method to the `Runner` class in the SDK, which properly handles the disconnection sequence.

3.  **Incorrect Enum Instantiation:** The TTS script failed when specifying the voice due to a `TypeError`.
    *   **Resolution:** The code was changed from `Voice(name="alloy")` to the correct enum access `Voice.ALLOY` after inspecting the SDK's `agents.py` file.

4.  **Real-time Simulation:** To properly test the STT script with a file, it was necessary to simulate a real-time audio stream.
    *   **Resolution:** A `time.sleep()` calculation was added to the file reading loop to ensure audio chunks were sent at a rate that mimics a live microphone feed.
