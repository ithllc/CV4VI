# Project Status: All Phases Complete

All planned phases for the AI-Powered Street Crossing Assistant Proof of Concept are now complete.

- **Phase 1: Setup & Core Component Testing:** All dependencies were installed and individual components (OpenAI STT/TTS, Selenium, Moondream) were tested successfully.
- **Phase 2: Web Automation & Camera Image Capture:** The Selenium control flow to navigate the NYCTMC website, find a camera, and capture a screenshot has been implemented and refined.
- **Phase 3: Moondream Analysis & Voice Integration:** The captured image is now analyzed by Moondream, and the voice input/output pipeline is fully integrated using OpenAI's APIs.
- **Phase 4: Streamlit UI & End-to-End Pipeline:** All components have been assembled into a functional Streamlit application, providing a complete end-to-end user experience.

The application is now in a working state as a proof-of-concept.
