# Next Steps for Your Hackathon Project

Congratulations on setting up your development environment! Here are some suggested next steps to guide you through your hackathon project.

## 1. Define Your Project Idea
- **Brainstorm:** Solidify your project's core idea and what problem you're trying to solve.
- **Scope:** Define the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). What are the absolute essential features you need to build in the limited time?

## 2. Plan Your Application
- **UI/UX Sketch:** Draw a rough sketch of your Streamlit application's user interface. What will the user see? What inputs will they provide?
- **Component Breakdown:** List the different components of your application (e.g., data input, processing logic, model inference, output display).

## 3. Start Coding
- **`main.py` / `app.py`:** Begin building the main structure of your Streamlit application.
- **Data Loading:** Write the code to load and preprocess your data. You might use `numpy` for numerical data, `Pillow` for images, or `laspy` for LiDAR data.
- **Model Integration:** Load your pre-trained `transformers` model using `torch` and write the functions to perform inference.
- **Feature Implementation:**
    - Use `selenium` if you need to automate a web browser for data scraping or interaction.
    - Use `pyttsx3` to add text-to-speech capabilities to your application.

## 4. Version Control
- **Initialize Git:** If you haven't already, initialize a Git repository to track your changes.
  ```bash
  git init
  git add .
  git commit -m "Initial commit: Project setup"
  ```
- **Commit Regularly:** Make small, frequent commits with clear messages.

## 5. Testing and Debugging
- **Test Incrementally:** Test each new feature as you build it.
- **Use the Debugger:** Get familiar with your code editor's debugger to step through your code and inspect variables.

## 6. Prepare for Presentation
- **README.md:** Update your `README.md` file with a clear description of your project, how to run it, and any dependencies.
- **Demo Script:** Prepare a short script for your final presentation or demo.

Good luck with the hackathon!
