# Refined POC Workplan: AI-Powered Street Crossing Assistant

**Overall Goal:** To create a proof-of-concept application where a user can use their voice to ask if it's safe to cross the street at their location. The system will use Selenium to control a web browser, navigate to the NYCTMC website, find the correct camera, capture a view of the feed, use Moondream to analyze the visual data, and provide a spoken answer back to the user via OpenAI's Realtime API for TTS.

## Phased Development Plan

### Phase 1: Setup & Core Component Testing (Hours 0-5)

**Goal:** Install all dependencies and ensure each core technology works in isolation. This is a critical de-risking phase.

1.  **Environment & Dependencies:**
    *   Create a Python virtual environment. (Status: Done, environment named `hackathon`)
    *   Confirm the existence of the packages listed or Install all necessary packages:
        ```bash
        pip install streamlit openai selenium transformers torch pillow "trust_remote_code" streamlit-mic-recorder webdriver-manager
        # Added webdriver-manager for easier WebDriver setup
        ```
    *   Ensure WebDriver for Selenium is correctly set up. `webdriver-manager` can handle this automatically, or download the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., `chromedriver`) and ensure it's in your system's PATH.
2.  **All project files in project folder:**
    *   Project folder is already created. It is called `AICHackathon`.
3.  **Configuration:**
    *   Set up your OpenAI API key. Store it securely, preferably using Streamlit's secrets management (`.streamlit/secrets.toml`):
        ```toml
        # .streamlit/secrets.toml
        OPENAI_API_KEY = "<YOUR-API-KEY-HERE>"
        ```
    *   OpenAI project details for reference:
        *   OpenAI project name: `AICVHackathon`
        *   API key associated with service account name: `CVHackathon`

4.  **Individual Component Tests ("Hello World" for each):**
    *   **OpenAI STT/TTS (Realtime):**
        *   **STT (Realtime Transcription):** Write a short Python script that uses the OpenAI Realtime Transcription API to capture audio from a microphone (or a pre-recorded file for initial testing) and prints the live transcription to the console. Refer to the OpenAI documentation: `https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime?connection-example=python&use-case=transcription`.
        *   **TTS (Realtime Audio Generation):** Write a short Python script that takes a sample text string and uses the OpenAI Realtime API (e.g., features within the Conversation guide or dedicated TTS if available under Realtime) to generate and play back speech. The goal is to hear the spoken output with minimal latency. Refer to OpenAI documentation, potentially starting with: `https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/realtime?connection-example=python&use-case=conversation` (for interactive TTS context) or any specific Realtime TTS examples.
    *   **Selenium (NYCTMC Interaction):** Write a Python script using Selenium that performs the following actions on `https://webcams.nyctmc.org/cameras-list`:
        1.  Initialize the Selenium WebDriver (e.g., Chrome).
        2.  Navigate to `https://webcams.nyctmc.org/cameras-list`.
        3.  Use `WebDriverWait` to ensure the camera list is loaded.
        4.  Locate and click the checkbox next to a specific camera in the list (e.g., "1 Ave @ 110 St", similar to `webcamnyccheckbox.png` changing to `webcamnyccheckboxchecked.png`). You'll need to identify the camera row and then the checkbox element within it.
        5.  Locate and click the green "View Selected" button in the upper middle pane (as seen in `webcamnyccheckboxchecked.png` leading to `webcamnyccheckboxcheckedandviewselectedclicked.png`).
        6.  Wait for the camera feed pop-up window to appear (as in `webcamnyccheckboxcheckedandviewselectedclicked.png`).
        7.  Within this pop-up, locate and click the "expand" button (often an icon with arrows pointing outwards) to get a larger view of the camera feed (leading to a view like `webcamnycsecondboxexpanded.png`).
        8.  Wait for the expanded camera view to load.
        9.  Locate and click the "X" (close) button at the top right of the expanded camera view/pop-up to close it.
        10. Close the browser instance (`driver.quit()`).
        *   **Goal:** Successfully automate this interaction flow without errors.
    *   **Moondream2:** Write a script that loads the Moondream2 model and provides a description for a local test image (e.g., a sample traffic photo downloaded from the internet). Ensure the model downloads correctly (`trust_remote_code=True` is vital). (Status: Done with `test_moondream.py`)

### Phase 2: Web Automation & Camera Image Capture (Hours 6-12)

**Goal:** Programmatically control a web browser to find a specific camera based on a user's location query, navigate the NYCTMC site, and capture a screenshot of its *expanded* feed.

1.  **Develop Selenium Control Flow Function:**
    *   Create a function `get_camera_feed_screenshot(location_query: str) -> str | None:`.
    *   **Steps within the function:**
        1.  Initialize the Selenium WebDriver (consider using `webdriver-manager` for robustness).
        2.  Navigate to `https://webcams.nyctmc.org/cameras-list`.
        3.  Use `WebDriverWait` for elements to load at each step.
        4.  **Locate Camera by Query:**
            *   Parse the `location_query` (e.g., "1st Avenue and 60th street").
            *   Iterate through the camera list elements on the page. For each camera, extract its displayed location text.
            *   Implement a matching logic to find the camera row that best matches the `location_query`. This might involve string similarity or keyword matching.
            *   If no match is found after a reasonable search, return `None`.
        5.  **Interact with Selected Camera:**
            *   Once the target camera row is identified, find and click its checkbox.
            *   Click the "View Selected" button.
            *   Wait for the initial (smaller) camera feed pop-up.
            *   Locate and click the "expand" button on this pop-up to get the larger view.
            *   Wait for the expanded camera feed to fully load.
        6.  **Capture Screenshot:**
            *   Identify the specific `<img>` tag or `<div>` that contains the video feed within the *expanded view*.
            *   Take a screenshot of only this element: `feed_element.screenshot('live_feed.png')`.
        7.  **Cleanup:**
            *   Close the expanded view (e.g., by clicking its close button).
            *   Close the Selenium WebDriver: `driver.quit()`.
        8.  Return the path to the screenshot (`'live_feed.png'`).
2.  **Refinement & Error Handling:**
    *   Implement robust `WebDriverWait` for all critical elements.
    *   Wrap major steps in `try...except` blocks (e.g., `TimeoutException`, `NoSuchElementException`).
    *   Log informative messages at each step or on error.
    *   Ensure the function returns `None` or raises a specific exception on failure so the main app can handle it.

### Phase 3: Moondream Analysis & Voice Integration (Hours 13-19)

**Goal:** Create the "brain" of the application by connecting the captured image to Moondream and wiring up the voice I/O using OpenAI's Realtime APIs.

1.  **Moondream Image Analysis Function:**
    *   Create a function `get_moondream_analysis(image_path: str) -> str:`.
    *   Load the Moondream2 model and tokenizer (ideally once, outside the function, if part of a class, or ensure efficient loading).
    *   Inside the function, load the image from `image_path` using Pillow: `Image.open(image_path).convert('RGB')`.
    *   Define the highly specific question/prompt for Moondream:
        ```python
        question = "You are a helpful assistant for a visually impaired person. Analyze this traffic camera image. Describe the pedestrian signal status (e.g., 'Walk' sign, 'Don't Walk' sign, countdown timer). Are there any cars, bicycles, or other vehicles currently moving through or about to enter the crosswalk area? Based ONLY on the visual information, conclude with a direct, one-sentence recommendation: 'It appears safe to cross the street now.' or 'It does not appear safe to cross the street now.' or 'Unable to determine safety from this image.'"
        ```
    *   Use the loaded Moondream model's appropriate method (e.g., `answer_question` or `generate`) to get the textual description based on the image and the question.
    *   Return the model's textual answer.
2.  **Voice Pipeline Functions (Using OpenAI Realtime APIs):**
    *   **Speech-to-Text (Realtime Transcription):**
        *   Create `transcribe_user_request_realtime(audio_bytes) -> str:` (or integrate into a class managing the realtime connection).
        *   This function will utilize the OpenAI Realtime Transcription API.
        *   It should be designed to process audio bytes (e.g., from `streamlit-mic-recorder`) and return the final transcribed text once the user finishes speaking.
        *   Refer to the OpenAI Realtime Transcription documentation for setting up the connection, sending audio data, and receiving transcription results.
    *   **Text-to-Speech (Realtime Audio Generation):**
        *   Create `generate_assistant_speech_realtime(text: str) -> bytes:` (or manage via a realtime conversation client).
        *   This function will use OpenAI's Realtime API features for TTS.
        *   It takes the final textual answer from Moondream.
        *   It should connect to the OpenAI service, send the text, and receive audio data (potentially streamed). For use with `st.audio`, it might need to accumulate the full audio stream into a bytes object.
        *   Ensure this aligns with how the OpenAI Realtime API delivers TTS output in Python (e.g., as complete audio data after synthesis, or chunks that you'd need to assemble).

### Phase 4: Streamlit UI & End-to-End Pipeline (Hours 20-24)

**Goal:** Assemble all components into a cohesive, user-friendly Streamlit application, ensuring smooth data flow from voice input to voice output.

1.  **Design the UI Flow:**
    *   Set a title: `st.title("AI Street Crossing Assistant")`.
    *   Add brief instructions on how to use the app.
    *   Use `streamlit_mic_recorder` (from `streamlit_mic_recorder import mic_recorder`) to provide a recording button:
        ```python
        audio_bytes = mic_recorder(start_prompt="Ask if it's safe to cross (e.g., 'I'm at Main Street and 1st Avenue, can I cross?')", stop_prompt="Processing...", key='recorder')
        ```
2.  **Orchestrate the Main Logic (triggered when `audio_bytes` is not None):**
    *   `if audio_bytes:`
        *   Display a status indicator: `with st.spinner('Understanding your request...'):`
        *   **Step 1 (STT):**
            *   `user_query = transcribe_user_request_realtime(audio_bytes)`
            *   `st.write(f"You asked: {user_query}")`
        *   `with st.spinner('Accessing traffic camera and analyzing view...'):`
        *   **Step 2 (Web Automation & Screenshot):**
            *   `image_path = get_camera_feed_screenshot(user_query)` # This function now handles finding the camera based on query
            *   If `image_path is None` or an error occurred:
                *   `st.error("Sorry, I couldn't access the camera feed for that location. Please try again or rephrase your location.")`
                *   (Potentially generate spoken error message too)
                *   `st.stop()`
        *   **Step 3 (Display Screenshot):**
            *   `st.image(image_path, caption="Live Camera View (snapshot)")`
        *   **Step 4 (VLM Analysis):**
            *   `analysis_text = get_moondream_analysis(image_path)`
        *   **Step 5 (TTS Output):**
            *   `st.success(f"Assistant's assessment: {analysis_text}")`
            *   `with st.spinner('Preparing audio response...'):`
                *   `speech_audio_bytes = generate_assistant_speech_realtime(analysis_text)`
                *   `st.audio(speech_audio_bytes, format="audio/wav")` # Adjust format if OpenAI provides different
3.  **Refinements and User Experience:**
    *   **State Management:** Ensure the app resets correctly for a new query. Consider using `st.experimental_rerun()` or structuring the app to handle new recordings cleanly.
    *   **Loading States:** Use spinners for each long-running operation (STT, Selenium, Moondream, TTS).
    *   **Error Handling:** Provide user-friendly messages for common errors (API failures, camera not found, Moondream issues).
    *   **README.md:** Create a comprehensive `README.md` detailing:
        *   Project purpose.
        *   Setup instructions (virtual environment, `pip install`, WebDriver, OpenAI API key in `secrets.toml`).
        *   How to run the Streamlit app (`streamlit run app.py`).
        *   Known limitations.

### Key Challenges & Mitigation (Updated)

*   **Selenium Flakiness & NYCTMC Site Structure:** The NYCTMC website's HTML structure or camera interaction flow could change, breaking selectors or the automation logic.
    *   **Mitigation:** Use the most stable selectors available (IDs > unique attributes > robust XPaths). Implement generous `WebDriverWait` timeouts. Modularize Selenium code so it's easier to update. During the hackathon, if this becomes a major blocker, have a pre-downloaded set of test images to switch to for demonstrating the Moondream and voice pipeline.
*   **Location Query to Camera Matching:** Accurately matching a natural language location query (e.g., "1st and 60th") to the camera names/descriptions in the NYCTMC list can be complex.
    *   **Mitigation:** Start with simple string matching. For a PoC, you might pre-define a few known locations and their exact camera names. A more advanced solution would use geocoding and proximity searches, but that's likely out of scope for 24h.
*   **Moondream Interpretation Accuracy:** The VLM might misinterpret blurry/low-quality images, complex scenes, or specific traffic signals (especially non-standard ones).
    *   **Mitigation:** The prompt engineering is crucial. Keep it highly specific. Displaying the captured image in the UI allows the user to make their own judgment, which is vital for safety-related applications. State clearly that it's an assistive tool.
*   **OpenAI Realtime API Integration:** Implementing realtime STT and TTS requires careful handling of streaming data, API connections, and potentially callbacks.
    *   **Mitigation:** Start with the simplest examples from the OpenAI documentation. Ensure API key and quota are sufficient. For TTS playback in Streamlit, if the API streams chunks, you may need to accumulate them before using `st.audio()` or explore custom components if low-latency playback during generation is critical.
*   **Overall Latency:** Each step (STT, Selenium, Moondream, TTS) adds latency. The goal is to make it feel responsive enough for a PoC.
    *   **Mitigation:** Optimize individual components where possible (e.g., efficient Selenium waits, quick Moondream inference if model is pre-loaded). Streamlit spinners help manage user perception of wait times. Realtime APIs for voice should help reduce perceived latency for STT/TTS parts.
